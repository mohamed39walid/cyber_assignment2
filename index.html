        <h3>üîê SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1)</h3>
        <p>SHA-1 is a cryptographic hash function that produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value. It's mainly used to ensure data integrity. Although now considered broken for high-security use cases, it was widely adopted in applications like SSL certificates and Git versioning.</p>

        <h3>üîê RSA Using LCG</h3>
        <p>RSA is a public-key cryptographic algorithm that relies on the hardness of factoring large integers. LCG (Linear Congruential Generator) can be used to generate pseudo-random prime numbers needed for key generation. However, using LCG for cryptographic purposes is not recommended in practice due to predictability.</p>

        <h3>üîê CTR Mode Using LCG</h3>
        <p>CTR (Counter) mode turns a block cipher into a stream cipher. Instead of a random IV, a counter is used for encryption. LCG can generate these counter values, but like with RSA, using LCG in real cryptographic contexts requires caution due to weak randomness.</p>
